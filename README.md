You need Node.js

## Running Locally

```
git clone https://github.com/NisanthanNanthakumar/palindrome.git
cd palindrome
npm i

cd client
npm i

cd ..
npm start
```

There is practise data in ./uploads directory. I assumed the JSON structure will be an array of objects. I also assumed that the palindrome strings have no punctuation and that letter case does not matter.
